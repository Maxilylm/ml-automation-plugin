# Model Evaluation

## When to Use
- Evaluating trained model performance
- Generating evaluation reports with visualizations
- Comparing models or analyzing errors

## Workflow

1. Generate predictions on test set
2. Compute appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1, AUC, RMSE, etc.)
3. Confusion matrix and classification report
4. ROC curves and precision-recall curves
5. Feature importance analysis
6. Error analysis on misclassified examples
7. Summary with actionable recommendations
