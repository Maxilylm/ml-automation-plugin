# Team Cold Start

## When to Use
- Starting a new ML project from raw data
- Running the full pipeline: EDA -> preprocess -> train -> evaluate -> deploy
- Getting a deployed dashboard from scratch

## Workflow

1. Initialize project structure
2. Analyze data (parallel: EDA, ML theory, features)
3. Preprocess and engineer features
4. Train and tune models
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Build interactive dashboard
7. Deploy to target environment
8. Generate completion report
